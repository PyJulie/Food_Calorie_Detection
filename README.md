# Food_Calorie_Detection  

A impletation of SVM+HOG to detection what food is in the picture  

DataSet:  
1.Strawberry  
        2.EggTart  
        Those are downloaded from Baidu Image by a Python script  
          
Uses:  
1.Use svmTrain() createTrainSamDescribeTxt() and createTestSamDescribeTxt() to build a model "DATA.xml"  
     2.Use svmTest() to test your test DataSet  
     

notes:I have also created a Qt GUI version,but it's a little difficult to build dependencies on your machine, so i don't prepare to upload the files.
